Here you would find a variety of projects (some of them not finished) that I have worked on during the past years. You would find groups projects, course projects, personal projects, etc. It may seem a little messy, but what's developing without a liitle of brainstorming right? 

Note: Many Java projects are currently private, since they were individual course projects and they were ordered to be private. I am currently working to see which ones I can set public.

Pinned below are some of my favorite projects!
