### Hello! Welcome to my GitHub :)

I'm Fabiola and here is a little bit about myself: 
- 💻 I'm studying Software Engineering at University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez Campus.
- 🎸 I have been playing the guitar for a long time and am currently learning to play the drums.
- 🥋 I am a Black Belt in Karate.
- ✔️ Incoming Meta SWE Engineer Intern on Summer 2022.
- 👀 Currently looking for a COOP opportunity in Puerto Rico for the Fall 2022.
- 👋 Let's connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fab-robles-vega/)
- 🙂 Pronouns: She/Her

Here you would find a variety of projects (some of them not finished) that I have worked on during the past years. You would find groups projects, course projects, personal projects, etc. It may seem a little messy, but what's developing without a liitle of brainstorming right? 

Note: Many Java projects are currently private, since they were individual course projects and they were ordered to be private. I am currently working to see which ones I can set public.

Pinned below are some of my favorite projects!
